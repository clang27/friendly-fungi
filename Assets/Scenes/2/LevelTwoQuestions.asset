  notes: "M0 does not enjoy nature so spends most of the day at the campfire\n\nM1
    gets excited with a fish jumps out and flips in front of him at the dock\n\nM2
    is afraid of heights so does not attend the campfire. He walks around and observes
    nature.\n\nM3 spends all day catching butterflies again near the campfire region
    lol\n\nM4 catches 3 frogs but loses one on the way home when they drop their
    glasses and pick them up\n\nM5 loses their hat at a random location but it blows
    to the woods\n\nM6 and M7 are frog catchers, however M7 does not have a net.
    M7 is much better at catching frogs than M6. M6 lives with M5 at the top L3.
    M7 starts the day not home but lives at L4. \n\nL0 and L1 at the bottom houses
    no one."
