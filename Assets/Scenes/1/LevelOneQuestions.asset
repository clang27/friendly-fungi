  notes: 'M0 gets spooked by an innocent looking creature while trying to climb from
    back, although a snake is walking around. Some people may thinking they''re afraid
    of heights


    M1 has a straight shot to the top of the heights after M0 gets
    spooked and doesn''t climb


    M2 is the one who is afraid of heights and starts
    to climb stair case before shaking their head and screaming and doing a 180


    M3

    2 mushrooms leave L0
    and 1 enters


    L1 is the highest point with no name'
