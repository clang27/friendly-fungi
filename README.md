# About

This is my finalist game about Critical Thinking in the 2023 Life. Love. Game Design Challenge presented by Gaming Against Violence and produced by Jennifer Ann's Group.

## How to Play

Look for clues and observe events that occur on the Shroo Kingdom's sky islands.
Control time to see anything play out again!
Use your journal to learn more about the Shroo and island and use it to write down notes.

### How to Win

Answer the Shroo mayor's inqueries for each sky island. 

### Controls

- *Left Click*: Select locations or Shroo
- *Right Click*: Use binoculars
- *A* or *D*: Rotate world

## Tips

- The game has settings to lower the quality (in case a judge's computer runs slower)
- If the world spinning feels like it is too slow or fast, there is an option for that in the settings also
